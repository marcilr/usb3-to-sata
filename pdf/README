  USB 3.0 SATA Enclosure 2.5 Inch USB 3.0 SATA Hard Drive
  Congratulations on your purchase of the new Sabrent EC-3US25 SuperSpeed USB 3.0
  Hard Drive Enclosure! The enclosure provides a secure and lightweight method of
  transporting and transferring large quantities of data at the fastest possible USB 3.0
  speeds, while still being reverse compatible with USB 1.1/2.0. Your computer will
  quickly detect and configure the connected Hard Drive (Plug & Play) via the USB
  connection, with no need to restart the computer. Blazing USB 3.0 speeds of up to
  5Gbps allow you to effortlessly run files directly from your hard drive, such as, songs,
  videos, and databases. The aluminum casing effectively dissipates heat, and its
  compact sleek design with mirror finish replaces the old eyesore hard drive enclosures
  of old.

  No Software or Drivers are needed to complete the connection.  The Hard Drive
  Enclosure should appear in Device Manager under the “Universal Serial Bus
  Controllers” as “USB Mass Storage” (There should be no error icon: ‘?’ or ‘!’)
  and the Hard Drive should appear in “MY COMPUTER” as a new Drive Letter.

  If the Hard-Drive is brand new you may need to first format it to make the
  Drive Letter appear. Right-click on MY COMPUTER, Select MANAGE, Go to DISK
  MANAGEMENT, go to the drive information in the Right column and Right-click
  on the drive to Initialize, Partition, Assign Drive Letter and Format.
  We recommend the NTFS file system.  At this point you should get the Drive
  letter in MY COMPUTER.
